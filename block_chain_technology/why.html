            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire world runs on information, and the introduction of databases
             helped with storing the data. However, the lack of security features in a database is one of the challenges to 
             its usage on the world wide web. One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data 
             is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. 
             Blocks have storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, 
             forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled 
             into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled
